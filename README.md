4. **Configure TypeScript**:

- Adjust the `tsconfig.json` file to align with your project's TypeScript requirements.

5. **Install Additional Dependencies**:

- Use `bun add <package-name>` to include any additional libraries or tools needed for your project.

6. **Test Your Application**:

- Write tests for your components and logic to ensure reliability and maintainability.

7. **Deploy Your Project**:

- Build the project using `bun run build` and deploy the output in the `dist/` folder to your preferred hosting platform.
